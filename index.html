<p>The UI provides significant support for scripts to query or modify the state of uicomponents, which are the building blocks of the user interface. The UI hierarchy of uicomponents may be browsed in script, and, once a handle to it has been obtained, the state of an individual uicomponent may be queried or modified through the uicomponent interface. The ui scripting interface is provided in all game environments.</p>

<p>Scripts can be run in multiplayer mode, although there are significant considerations that must be taken into account when creating multiplayer script in order to make script multiplayer-safe. Script that is not multiplayer-safe may diverge when run on different machines in the same game, which can cause a desync.</p>
